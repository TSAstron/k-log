# K-Log

This repository will contain my attempt at a continued logarithms library.
It is based on Bill Gosper's idea of numbers as stateful objects, and relies also on the standard continued fractions.
In both cases arbitrary precision/number of digits/terms is supported.

See the related repository: [matrix-numbers](https://github.com/TSAstron/matrix-numbers),<br>
and my articles: [popular/general one](https://monodromy.group/zoomed/), and [one about accelerated expansion of Ï€](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01295).
